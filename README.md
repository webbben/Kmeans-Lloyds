# Kmeans-Lloyds

Description:
K means Lloyd's algorithm implementation that finds k number of centroids based on the clusters generated from input data points.
This code was made to complete a Rosalind coding challenge for my Bioinformatics Algorithms course at IU.  Therefore, the input needs to
be formated how Rosalind requires, and the output is formatted such that Rosalind can read the answer.
There is an input.txt which shows an example (the data used when solving the coding challenge), but the basic format is:

k (# of centroids) m (dimensionality of data)
data point
data point
...

How to run:
* put desired data in input.txt (or use preset data provided)
* run lloyd.py
Output will display the coordinates of each centroid of the clusters generated from the input data
